# Rules To Follow while sending pull request:
-Read contribution.md before proceeding.
- Please follow the file structure given, i.e Put your code in the respective folders only. Example if you want to add a data structure in cpp language do it in the specific folder. If you prefer in another language make a new folder (if not already present) and follow the same file structure there. 
- Do not push spam codes (They should be proper codes and not just one liners or space fixes).
- Please try to add extended descriptions about the code you are adding.
- Single line commits will be closed and will be marked as spam.
- **For DSA Code**:
    Try to add time and space complexity to the actual code as comments.

```
---
First line, no more than 50 characters

Details section, as long as you want. Not always necessary, but
available if you need it. Wrapped at 72 characters. Present imperative
tense is preferred for commits. That means "fix bug", not "fixes bug" or
"fixed bug".

- Use bullets if you need
- Bullets are a good way to summarize a few things

If you have too much info here, it might be a good candidate to break
down into multiple commits. You can use emoji here too :sparkles:
