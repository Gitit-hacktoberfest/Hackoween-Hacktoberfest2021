# Competitive coding

- This repo is a collection of the various algorithms I have implemented. It also has  the solutions of some of the codechef problems I solved . C++ and Standard Template Library (STL) were used .
- template.cpp is the template that I made for programming contests. This template has the code ( in the form of preprocessor directives ) that shortens the frequently used library functions and data-types. This template also has some code that reduces execution time of any c++ code by 4-5 times. 
- I followed this awesome book for competitive coding : <https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf>
